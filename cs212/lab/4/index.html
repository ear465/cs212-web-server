                <h3>Background</h3>
                <p>Despite intensive research, cancer remains a major health problem. The difficulties in treating cancer reflect the complex nature of this disease, including high levels of heterogeneity within tumours. Intra-tumour heterogeneity creates the conditions for inter-clonal competition and selection, which could result in selective sweeps and a reduction in levels of heterogeneity. However, in addition to competing, cancer clones can also cooperate with each other, and the positive effects of these interactions on the fitness of clones could actually contribute to maintaining the heterogeneity of tumours. Consequently, understanding the evolutionary mechanisms and pathways involved in such activities is of great significance for cancer treatment. This is particularly relevant for metastasis (i.e., tumor cell migration, invasion, dispersal and dissemination), which is the most lethal phase during cancer progression. To explore if and how genetically distant clones can cooperate during migration and invasion, this study used three distinct cancer cell lines with different metastatic potentials.</p>

                <h3>Results</h3>
                <p>We found that (i) the conditioned media from two invasive lines (breast and lung) increased the migration and invasion potential of a poorly metastatic line (breast), and (ii) this inter-clonal cooperative interaction involved the TGF-β1 signalling pathway. Furthermore, when the less aggressive line was co-cultured with the highly metastatic breast line, the invasive potential of both lines was enhanced, and this outcome was dependent on the co-option (through TGF-β1 autocrine-paracrine signalling) of the weakly metastatic clone into expressing an enhanced malignant phenotype that benefited both clones (i.e., a “help me help you” strategy).</p>

                <h3>Conclusions</h3>
                <p>Based on our findings, we propose a model in which crosstalk, co-option, and co-dependency can facilitate the evolution of synergistic cooperative interactions between genetically distant clones. Specifically, we suggest that synergistic cooperative interactions can easily emerge, regardless of the degree of overall genetic/genealogical relatedness, via crosstalk involving metastatic clones able to constitutively secrete molecules that induce and maintain their own malignant state (producer-responder clones) and clones that have the ability to respond to those signals (responder clones) and express a synergistic metastatic behaviour. Taking into account the lack of therapies that directly affect the metastatic process, interfering with such cooperative interactions during the early steps in the metastatic cascade could provide additional strategies to increase patient survival.</p>

                <h2>Background</h2>
                
                <p>Despite intensive research, cancer remains the second cause of death worldwide [1]. The difficulties in curing cancer or preventing tumour progression reflect the complex nature of this disease, including high levels of heterogeneity between and within tumours. In particular, increased intra-tumour heterogeneity is generally linked to poor prognosis and poses a direct problem to therapies as drug resistance will ultimately evolve [2, 3]. According to the clonal evolution model of cancer, intra-tumour heterogeneity creates the conditions for inter-clonal competition and selection, which could result in selective sweeps and a general reduction in levels of heterogeneity [4]. However, it has been suggested that in addition to competing, cancer clones could also cooperate with each other (e.g., [5]), and the positive effects of these activities on the fitness of clones can actually contribute to maintaining the heterogeneity of tumours [6]. In addition, cooperation has been linked to drug resistance [7, 8], tumour growth [9, 10] and increased metastatic potential [11].</p>

                <p>It should be noted that the term cooperation is generally used (including in the context of cancer) to denote either (i) an adaptive social behaviour that provides a benefit to another individual and evolved at least partially due to that benefit, or (ii) an interaction that is based on activities resulting in fortuitous benefits (such as feeding upon waste products) that, nevertheless, could evolve into cooperative behaviours (see discussion in [12]). In the former context, the actor can gain indirect benefits by directing the act towards individuals that carry the cooperative gene (e.g., involving discrimination or assortment; costly/altruistic cooperation) or direct fitness benefits that outweigh the costs of performing the behaviour (e.g., through shared interests in cooperation; mutually beneficial cooperation). Similarly, in the latter context, either one or both partners can benefit (commensalism vs. mutualism). Notably, although mutually beneficial cooperation and mutualism are often used synonymously, the two terms in fact describe very different processes: mutually beneficial cooperation implies a single behaviour that affects both the actor and recipient, whereas mutualism describes the effects that each partner has on the other—as in between species (see discussion in [12]). The most common framework for cooperation among tumour cells is the “by-product mutualism” proposed by Axelrod et al. [5], in which partially or fully transformed subclones exchange diffusible factors associated with their routine activities, which might result in benefits that neither could access alone.</p>

                <p>Metastasis—characterized by the ability of tumour cells to migrate, invade neighbouring tissues and spread to new sites within the body, is the most lethal stage during cancer progression. To migrate, tumour cells need to undergo several changes—known as the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) [13], in which cell transition from an epithelial state (with cells connected to each other and attached to the basal membrane) to a mesenchymal state (involving the loss of cell-cell connections and adhesion) followed by the acquisition of cytoplasmic extensions and migratory abilities. The classical view of metastasis envisions single cells migrating and invading neighbouring tissues, dispersing via the vascular system, and disseminating to distant locations. However, more recent findings that some of these steps (e.g., migration, invasion, dispersal) might, in fact, involve groups of cells rather than single cells allows for the possibility that cooperation can actually contribute to successful dispersal, colonization and poor prognosis [11].</p>

                <p>In the early stages of metastasis, such cooperative interactions can involve the induction of changes in the phenotype/state of a nearby clone that increase its metastatic potential. For example, it has been suggested that aggressive cancer cells can release signals (e.g., cytokines, chemokines, growth factors, exosomes, miRNAs) that induce EMT and enhance the metastatic potential of non-metastatic clones (see examples using melanoma [14], lung [15, 16] and breast cancer cell lines [17, 18]). Additionally, prostate mesenchymal clones were found to secrete a matricellular protein that increased the invasive capacity of epithelial clones after inducing EMT [19].</p>

                <h1>Addendum </h1>
                <h2>Overall</h2>
                <p>I chose a lavender background to have something less harsh than white while still being able to have a contrasting, dark text. I also added some padding to the page to add space between the text and the edge of the page. This makes the content easy to read and navigate. </p>
                <h2>Headings</h2>
                <p>All of the headings are a sans serif font(Archivo Black) in small caps and dark blue color. I chose this for good visibility and contrast. I also modified their size and line height.</p>
                <h2>Main Text</h2>
                <p>The text of the paragraphs and references list is a serif font(EB Garamond). I've also added ample line height and a somewhat large font size to improve readability.</p>
                <h2>Authors</h2>
                <p>As a minor touch, I changed the color of the authors names (and increased the size a bit) to hopefully draw more attention to them. </p>
